Updates based on Feedback

- Added more comments using intelliSense
- I changed from using "==" while comparing strings to using "string.Equals()".
- I renamed labels, textboxes, and comboboxes to use better naming conventions 
  to better understand the purpose of that component.
- Upon clicking the exit button located at the top right corner of the window 
  the application closes and does not hang.

(Unfortunately due to the layout and structure of this application it will be 
difficult to minimize the nested loops while maintaining the functionality of the application.)
