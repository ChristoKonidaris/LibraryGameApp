Task1
Once the application has started the user will be prompted with three buttons.
Only the first button, being Replacing books, will be enabled.
Once the user has chosen Replacing books, they will be taken to the replacing books screen where they will be able to 
randomly generate 10 call numbers.
They can then select the call numbers one by one and use the move value up and move value down buttons to change the order
to ascending order.
Once they are complete they will click the finish button, the program will then sort and check if the users answer is correct.
If not the application will tell the user to try again.
If they are successful the user will have a dialog message saying congratulations and a gamification feature saying trophy earned.
The user can then continue using the application or choose to exit out of it.

Task2
If the user returns to the home screen they are now able to select the Identifying areas option.
If the user selects this option they are taken to the identifying ares screen where they will be tasked to match column A with column B.
Firstly, the user is able to select from two question options. 
The first being matching the categories to the call numbers and the second being matching call numbers to categories. 
If the user chooses the first option Column A will fill with 4 different categories and Column B will be filled with 7 different call numbers.
The user is then tasked to match column A with the correct answers from column B.
They are able to use the answer column to select which letter corresponds with the matching question in column A.
If the user does not supply any answers then an error message will appear prompting the user to select their answers.
Once the user has selected their answers they are able to click the done button.
An achievement will appear telling the user what badge they have earned and what they have earned it for.
Once the user click okay, the correct dewey decimal system showing what call numbers match what categories.
The user will then be able to clear and choose the same question displaying a completely different set of questions and answers,
or they will be able to select the other question displaying call numbers in column A and categories in column B.
They can then complete the matching column task the same way as mentioned above. 
The user can continue with the application and answer as many questions as they like or choose to exit at any time.
The user is also able to go back to the home screen and is then able to access other parts of the application.  
(Note:If generating the column A and column B questions and answers takes some time, please be patient.
This is due to the high resolution background. Should this problem continue to occur for extended periods of time,
simply remove the background image. Thank you!)
